Note: this project is a work in progress. It is not yet fully functional.

## Technologies

## The project
In this project, you'll build a fully-functional link-sharing app for developers! You'll practice working with image uploads, repeater fields, drag-and-drop, and more!

## Challenges
- Create, read, update, delete links and see previews in the mobile mockup
- Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
- Drag and drop links to reorder them
- Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
- Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
- Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- Bonus: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
